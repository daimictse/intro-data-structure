1.
a) var peopleLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b) peopleLine.push("Mary")

c)
function findPerson(name) {
  for (var i=0; i<peopleLine.length; i++) {
      if (peopleLine[i] === name) {
        return i;
      }
  }
  return -1;
}
findPerson("Josh");  // return 2

d)
findPerson("Emily"); // return -1

e)
function cutBefore(personCutting, beforePerson) {
  for (var i=0; i<peopleLine.length; i++) {
    if (peopleLine[i] === beforePerson) {
      return peopleLine.splice(i, 0, personCutting);
    }
  }
}

f)
function removePerson(name) {
  for (var i=0; i<peopleLine.length; i++) {
    if (peopleLine[i] === name) {
      return peopleLine.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
}

2. A data structure can be used for the products of an eCommerce.
  The products is a list of SKUs, represented as string.
  There is a front to the list, as well as a back.
  When there's a new SKU, place it at the end.
  When there's a discontinued SKU, remove them from the list.

3. An array data structure can be used for the above model. As the above case in number 1, push() can be used to insert a new SKU and splice() can be used to remove a discontinued SKU.
